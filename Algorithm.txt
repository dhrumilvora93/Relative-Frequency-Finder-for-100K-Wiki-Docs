Algorithm:-


This Algorithm uses 2 Pairs of Mappers & Reducers.
In the first Mapper, each line is split using the RegEx for a blank space and then then trimmed.
The 2 adjacent words are then iteratively set as the Key and their value is set as 1 by default.
The Combiner is then executed to group the keys.
The Reduce phase calculates the relative frequencies for each key and is written in the context.But this is not in descending order as required and hence, another pair of a Mapper and a Reducer is required.So the temporary output of this phase 'temp_output' is sent as an input to the 2nd Mapper.
In the 2nd Mapper, the keys and values from the previous stage are interchanged so that the Descender class can sort the relative frequencies in descending order as required.
The 2nd Reducer filters out the results with relative frequencies as 1.0 and also lists out only the top 100 results.
